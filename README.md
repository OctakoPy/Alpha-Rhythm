# Overview

I developed this project using Bolt AI. It is pretty crazy that it took me just a week (about 15 minutes/day) to get the fundamental gameplay working, then one more week for some tweaking and adjustments. This was also my first foray into Typescript, React and Supabase integration.

# Gameplay

• Type words that start with the shown letter

• Each word must be unique - no repeats!
• Longer words give more points

• There are 6 levels to beat. As you level up:

    Required word length increases
    Time limit decreases
    Music gets faster
    
• Ascend past level 6 and immortalise your score on the all-time leaderboard!

# Issues
• Dictionary can easily be abused to cheat the game
• Database calls are exposed in frontend
• Game gets boring after first few rounds

# Credits
• Music generated using Suno AI
